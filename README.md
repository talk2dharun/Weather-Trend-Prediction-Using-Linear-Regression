# Weather-Trend-Prediction-Using-Linear-Regression
This project fetches weather data for any city across the world using the OpenWeatherMap API, processes it into a structured dataset, and applies Linear Regression to predict future temperature trends. The data is resampled daily, missing values are interpolated, and a machine learning model is trained to analyze temperature variations over time.
